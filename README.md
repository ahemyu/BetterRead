# BetterRead

This is my endeavor of actually getting gud at programming. 
I want to write a performant pdf reader with actual useful llm integration that one can navigate with vim bindings.
The motivation for this arises out of the annoying task of copy pasting chunks of the books I read on my pc back and forth between llm chatbots.
