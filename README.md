# BetterRead

This is my endeavor of actually getting gud at programming. 
I want to write a performant pdf reader with actual useful llm integration that one can navigate with vim bindings.
The motivation for this arises out of the annoying task of copy pasting chunks of the books I read on my pc back and forth between llm chatbots.

My clear determined goal is to write each and every line of code of this project by hand, as this is a quest for me.

Initial goal is to write this as a linux desktop applicaton.

The features I really want to get in are: 
- Actual nice to use llm chat integration with proper context about the section you are reading right now (so basically context-engineering)
- vim/vim-like keybindings to read pdfs and ask the llms questions as fast as possible.
- it should be really fast and responsive
